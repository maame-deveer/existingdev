<div align="justify">Navigating the labyrinth of tech as a junior developer has been a rollercoaster of uncertainty, self-discovery, and relentless determination. Here's a glimpse into my journey so far:</div>

## Humble Beginnings

<div align="justify"> My first encounter with programming in general was in my first year in university. With Python being the introductory language. Unfortunately, I struggled with it. Low-key I don't like Python due to these reasons. I had to retake the class nearly three times. Eventually, due to various reasons, I had to leave and start my first year at a different university. There instead of diving straight into programming, we started with theory, a subject called Elements Of Programming. Where I learnt to write pseudocode and programming basics were broken down to a level I actually understood. Then we started with Java as our first programming language and I loved it. Eventually, by the end of uni, we were introduced to three languages overall, Java, C++ and C#. </div>

<div align="justify">My final year in uni was when I decided to stick to C# as my main language, mainly because I was not sure what I wanted to do, but at least I wanted to learn unity. Starting with the basics again, I dived into the vast sea of C# and dotnet. Luckily I found a YouTube video that recommended various books for a C# backend developer and I have to say they have helped with my learning so far. I wish I made this decision early in school, so I didn't have to relearn a lot of stuff but more about the tech stack I want to have expertise in.</div>

## The Struggle for Opportunities

<div align="justify">So far my hunt for my first junior dev role has been unfruitful. A lot of the dev roles I have found are mainly for intermediate to senior developers, mainly in my country. Most jobs ask for an absurd number of skills and I am just out of uni. I have tried applying for junior dev roles outside my country but so far I have been rejected. At least they send a rejection mail, most do not even acknowledge nor send one. This unfortunately has contributed to my growing self-doubt. Countless rejections have tested my resolve, but I refuse to let the setbacks define me.</div>

<div align="justify">I want professional experience and to greatly improve my skills. I have also applied to a few internships, but I have been rejected from some of those too. Another option is to go on and complete my master's and find a job from there, but I already feel left behind and to me having a Master's degree with no professional experience in tech is useless. After all, experience is more valuable than academic achievement.</div>

## Embracing the Learning Curve

<div align="justify">As a junior, the learning curve has felt like an uphill battle. Impostor syndrome is a constant companion. Yet, every bug I fix, every project I complete, becomes a victory etching progress into my journey. I don't like self-diagnoses but I know I might have ADHD due to a few reasons and would like to get tested to be sure. I find it difficult to complete or continue projects. Even though I have it in mind to do so and try to schedule my time. By the end of the day, I realised I had not completed any of my goals.</div>

<div align="justify">Also, I have been trying to complete Freecodecamp's #100DaysOfCode challenge, but I never seem to be consistent even though I technically code almost every day. So to solve that I have been trying to build a simple Telegram bot to act as a to-do list that will send the updates (tweets) for each day and my progress. I started building it, but it's been catching dust for a while. So I have decided to document my journey and turn all I learn into little posts and tutorials to see how that goes.</div>

## Navigating the Tech Ecosystem

<div align="justify">The world of technology is truly fascinating, especially when it comes to the many types of developer jobs available. I find myself drawn to a number of different areas, including Blockchain, Backend Development, Fintech, Game Dev, and Web Development. There are so many incredible things I would love to create, not necessarily for commercial gain, but rather to satisfy my own curiosity and personal interests. Unfortunately, I don't yet have the skills required to bring these ideas to life.</div>

<div align="justify">For now, I feel like I need to focus on one particular path and gain some work experience in that area before I can fully explore other avenues as a personal hobby. That's why I've chosen to become a dotnet developer, specifically working with C#. The dotnet ecosystem covers a wide range of areas, which means that I'll be able to explore many of them with the skills I'm currently building. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!</div>

## The Power of "I Don't Know"

<div align="justify">I have realized nowadays that accepting I don’t know and asking for help is really important. Sometimes googling and using chatgpt is not enough. Sometimes help comes from asking someone with more experience than you do. Even if they also don’t know, their suggestions may contain a solution you did not even know of or think about. I had such an encounter and got to learn about using a Registry for sharing data across various classes or pages when building a .net maui project. It was really eye-opening. Acknowledging you don’t know and reaching out for help can really help make navigating the tech world much easier.</div>

## Celebrating Small Wins

<div align="justify">Fixing a bug, completing a tutorial – these have become my small milestones to celebrate. Celebrating small wins nurtures confidence and has helped me see that progress is often a series of steps, not leaps. So for every goal I complete, no matter how small or insignificant, I will see that as a win and progress towards my main aim.</div>

## The Road Ahead

<div align="justify">While the path ahead remains uncertain, I embrace it with newfound courage. The pursuit of a junior dev job continues, but the journey itself has become the destination – a process of self-discovery.</div>

## A Call to Fellow Journeymen

<div align="justify">To all fellow junior devs grappling with uncertainty, remember: you're not alone. Our journeys are as unique as the code we write. Let's share experiences, learn together, and find strength in our collective pursuit.</div>
