<div align="justify">I came across rust during my national service. My curiosity was sparked when told about its memory management capabilities, which i thought was nothing unique when it comes to programming languages. Example, C-Sharp has similar capabilities with garbage collection. But i was wrong. What makes rust really unique is the concept of ownership, a topic i'll write more on later. Initially i had plans of learning Javascript as my second language from C-Sharp but Rust captured my attention, especially with the fact that it is used extensively in embedded systems, an area i wish to transition to when i become an intermediate developer. Another great thing about rust is the available resources for learning, they are free, easily accessible and regularly updated by its robust developer community.</div>
