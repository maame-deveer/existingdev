<div align="justify">2023 was an interesting year. So many tech advancements and personal ones too. As the new year begins it is only right to reflect on the previous year, whether it's tech accomplishments or personal achievements. I looked at tech events that caught my attention and expanded my thoughts on them in a previous <a href="https://maame-deveer.github.io/techhollow/2024-01-10-highlights-in-tech-in-2023/" target="_blank">article</a>. Now i want to reflect on my personal highlights from last year and plan my goals for the new year.</div>

## Personal Highlights

<div align="justify">As the previous year ends and the new year begins, reflecting on the year gone by offers not just a moment of nostalgia but a beacon of motivation for the year ahead. The journey through 2023 was nothing short of an adventureâ€”a blend of challenges met, skills honed, and boundaries pushed. Among the myriad experiences that the year bestowed upon me, completing my studies and getting my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, advancing my knowledge in C#, participating in my first game jams, diving into the creation of a class library, made my first opensource contribution and beginning my foray into the Rust programming language stand out as personal and professional highlights. Each of these milestones not only enriched my understanding of software development but also shaped the path I wish to tread in the upcoming year.</div>
<br>
<div align="justify">Using "C# 10 and .NET 6 - Modern Cross-Platform Development" by Mark J. Price, I embarked on a journey to deepen my grasp of C#, a journey that proved to be both enlightening and instrumental in paving the way for future explorations. The game jams, with their themes of robotics and Halloween, offered a hands-on experience in creativity, teamwork, and resilience, even when the outcomes were not as expected. Venturing into the architectural depths of building a class library, opensource and tackling the Rust programming language opened new horizons of coding paradigms and efficiency. This proves that my year has been one of great pogress and i will work on the same happening this year.</div>
