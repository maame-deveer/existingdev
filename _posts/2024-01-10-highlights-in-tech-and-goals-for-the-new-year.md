## AI's Soaring Heights

In 2023, artificial intelligence reached new heights, fueled by breakthroughs in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. The race to release the best AI related products started. Tech has left the blockchain craze and is hyping up AI use cases. With OpenAI heading this phase with their releasing and improvements on ChatgGPT. The integration of AI into various industries, from healthcare to finance, showcased its potential to revolutionize how we live and work. But not everything is cherry as it seems, from [a game studio firing it's artists to utilise image generative AI](https://www.itechpost.com/articles/117755/20230531/game-developer-accused-firing-artists-replacing-ai.htm), to people utilizing deepfakes to [scam companies](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/feb/05/hong-kong-company-deepfake-video-conference-call-scam) and the unfortunate cases where [deepfake porn](https://healthnews.com/mental-health/anxiety-depression/the-damage-caused-by-deepfake-porn/) was generated using victims images which [led to suicide](https://metro.co.uk/2024/01/24/teen-took-life-online-bullying-shared-fake-nudes-20162284/). Given the rise of malicious uses of AI in deepfakes and misinformation, there's a keen interest in advocating for stronger regulations and cybersecurity measures. If not cases like these will continue growing. There is always an ethical aspect in technology, because bad actors will always try to use it for the wrong reasons. Hopefully these regulations come quickly before things get out of hand.

## Edge Computing's Prowess

So like me, if you came across this you would be wondering what exactly it is about. Well edge computing means doing the computer work (like analyzing data) closer to where the data is collected (like a smart thermostat, security cameras, or your smartphone), rather than sending all that data far away to a data center or cloud to be processed. This closer processing makes things work faster and more efficiently, which is especially important for gadgets and services that need quick responses, like self-driving cars or streaming videos without buffering.Edge computing has emerged as a game-changer, allowing data processing closer to the source. This has not only enhanced efficiency but also paved the way for real-time applications and reduced latency, offering a glimpse into the future of decentralized computing.

## 5G's Integration
 
In 2023, as 5G technology continued to roll out globally, it brought with it transformative potential for connectivity, speed, and efficiency.The widespread adoption of 5G technology brought lightning-fast connectivity, enabling seamless communication and empowering the Internet of Things (IoT). This breakthrough had a profound impact on industries like telecommunications, healthcare, and smart cities. But like with all tech there will always be issues. This next generation of mobile networks also faced several challenges and issues that stakeholders had to address. One of this issue was widespread panic over electromagnetic radiation, misinformation and concerns about health effects persisted. These [unfounded fears](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/radiation-5g-mobile-networks-and-health) sometimes led to public opposition to the deployment of new 5G infrastructure. Also as the efficiency and speed of connectivity increases, so does cybersecurity issues. According to [NetworkWorld](https://www.networkworld.com/article/972286/5g-network-slices-could-be-vulnerable-to-attack-researchers-say.html), even though 5G promises increased speed, lower latency, and support for a significantly larger number of connected devices, the growth in devices and in new applications will expand the attack surface upon which malicious actors can use to advantage of security gaps.

## Sustainable Tech Initiatives

In response to global concerns about the environment, 2023 saw a surge in sustainable technology initiatives. Companies embraced eco-friendly practices, and innovations in energy-efficient technologies and green computing emerged as key focal points. Tech giants like [Google and Microsoft](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/energy/google-microsoft-partner-energy-firms-clean-grid) made significant strides in powering their data centers with renewable energy sources. Companies like [Apple and Samsung](https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/a-fully-recycled-phone-is-a-lot-harder-than-it-sounds-even-for-samsung-and-apple/) introduced new products made with a higher proportion of recycled materials, including recycled aluminum, plastic, and rare earth elements. The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in agriculture, known as smart farming, became more prevalent. These technologies enable more efficient water use, optimize fertilizer application, and increase crop yields, all of which contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices. Sustainable tech has seen agreat progress in 2023.

## C# and .NET Evolution

As a budding dotnet developer, it is only right I include c-sharp and dotnet related highlights. Microsoft's C# and .NET continued their evolution in 2023, solidifying their position as go-to tools for software development. Performance enhancements, new language features, and robust support for cross-platform development further endeared these technologies to developers worldwide. Continuous efforts were made to enhance the performance of C# and .NET, ensuring faster execution and improved resource utilization. The cross-platform capabilities of C# and .NET became increasingly prominent, enabling developers to create applications that seamlessly run across different operating systems, broadening their reach and impact. Also let's not forget the [release of .Net 8](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-8/overview).
