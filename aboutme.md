Hi I'm Maame Lankar De Veer, the wandering mind behind this blog:

- I am simply existing
- I love tech and want to explore every aspect of it if possible
- I watch anime
- Listen to a lot of music
- I also love sleeping

## about me  

I am a junior software engineer figuring out my footing in the tech world. Mainly coding in C# and eager to explore the .Net Ecosystem. Also currently learning rust, excited to explore its memory management and safety capabilities. I want to document my journey as a software engineer as I explore the deep hollow that is the tech world.
